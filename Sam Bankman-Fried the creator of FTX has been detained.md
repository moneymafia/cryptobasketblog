**Sam Bankman-Fried was detained in the Bahamas at the request of the United States government**, just a day before the disgraced former FTX CEO was scheduled to testify before Congress.


According to a Dec. 12 announcement from the Bahamas Attorney General (AG) and Minister of Legal Affairs Ryan Pinder, Bankman-Fried was arrested by the Royal Bahamas Police Force following a formal notification from the US government that it had brought [criminal charges against him](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html).

The United States will almost certainly request [Bankman-extradition](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-reportedly-considering-bankman-fried-extradition-for-questioning), Fried's with Pinder noting that the Bahamas will **"promptly"** process any extradition request.

According to Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis, both countries have a *"common interest in holding accountable all people affiliated with FTX who may have abused the public trust and broken the law."*

According to a tweet from the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York on December 12, officials in the Bahamas arrested Bankman-Fried based on a sealed indictment that the office planned to unseal **"in the morning."**

According to a Dec. 10 Bloomberg article, prosecutors from New York, FBI agents and regulators met with FTX's attorneys to go over the paperwork that investigators are looking for.


When FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was **"closely"** scrutinising whether the corporation had fraudulently moved hundreds of millions at that time.


According to Pinder's announcement on November 27 that the Securities Commission, Financial Intelligence Unit, and Police's Financial Crimes Unit were all engaged, Bahamian authorities were also conducting their own **"active and ongoing"** investigation into FTX.

A day before he was scheduled to appear remotely to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services in a hearing looking into the collapse of the exchange, Bankman-Fried was arrested.
