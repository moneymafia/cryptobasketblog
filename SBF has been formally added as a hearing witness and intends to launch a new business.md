The founder and former CEO of the insolvent cryptocurrency exchange FTX has indicated interest in launching a new business to recover the money he owes to his clients.


*"To be able to accomplish that I would do anything. And I'll make an effort, if I can "* In an interview with the BBC on December 10, Sam Bankman-Fried was asked if he would launch a new company to compensate FTX consumers.


According to bankruptcy proceedings on November 14, Bankman-exchange Fried's may have **"more than 1 million creditors."** The amount that FTX could have lost is estimated to be between $10 billion and $50 billion.

During his **'media apology tour,'** Bankman-Fried repeated prior claims that he "didn't purposely engage in fraud. I don't believe I was dishonest.

Additionally, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that he **“was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was."**

The FTX founder is been formally confirmed as a witness for the Dec. 13 hearing with the House Committee on Financial Services following days of back and forth between US House Representative Maxine Waters and Bankman-Fried.

His name is now formally included as a witness for the Dec. 13 hearing, titled [**"Investigating the Collapse of FTX, Part I,"**](https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=410002) as of Dec. 11.

The second witness is none other than John Ray, the new CEO of FTX, who had previously been added as of December 9.

Bankman-Fried controversially skipped the deadline to confirm his attendance at a Senate Committee hearing on the failure of FTX, set for December 14.

Sherrod Brown, the committee chair, informed Bankman-Fried in a letter dated December 7 that he was ready **"to issue a subpoena to compel your testimony."**

Bankman-Fried missed the deadline, according to a Dec. 9 [statement](https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-toomey-update-sam-bankman-fried-testimony) from Brown and Sen. Pat Toomey, and the committee  **“will continue to work on having him appear before Congress.”**

On December 9, Toomey tweeted that he was **“glad”**  Bankman-Fried would attend the House hearing and that he anticipated seeing the FTX founder in the Senate hearing the following day.
