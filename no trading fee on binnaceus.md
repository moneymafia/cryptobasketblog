The US exchange has also abolished gas costs on all Ethereum transactions performed through its website's __"Buy & Sell"__ function.
Binance, which caters mostly to US crypto dealers, has now eliminated all trading fees for Ethereum. Binance US is a separate organization in the United States that uses the same name and logo as the Binance Global Crypto Exchange. According to a source, Binance's president cuts fees for both Ethereum and bitcoin trading.


The CEO Said __"By eliminating these fees, we continue to cement our position as the low-fee leader in crypto, bringing greater pricing competition & helping to restore trust in the broader ecosystem. Now, more than ever, platforms must operate with users’ interests first"__

Offering zero-fee on transfers encourages users to interact more with digital assets, and because exchanges play a critical role in crypto adoption, the firm has taken these efforts to benefit consumers. If the transaction is too costly, most consumers will not use these technologies.
