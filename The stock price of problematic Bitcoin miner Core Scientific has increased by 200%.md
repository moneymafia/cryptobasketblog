**Core Scientific's shares has risen about 200% in the last four days, following a positive response to a Dec. 14 funding proposal from a current creditor hoping the company may escape bankruptcy.**


Shares of the beleaguered miner were worth just over 13 cents on December 12 before surging to nearly 40 cents when the market closed on December 15 – a 198% increase.

According to financial media business Marketbeat, traders [purchased](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-corz-options-data-report-2022-12-2/) 6,572 call options on December 15, 136% higher than the typical volume of 2,780, showing that many investors are positive on the stock and believe the price will rise further.

Some members of the Bitcoin community purchased shares in the hopes of making a large profit if the financing plan goes through and the company survives the bear market.

The rally could be the start of a new trend, or it could simply be a dead cat bounce. Core Scientific has had a string of terrible news throughout 2022, and despite recent gains, the stock is still 95% lower than it was at the beginning of the year.

**On December 14, financial services platform B. Riley sent a [letter](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-issues-open-letter-to-core-scientific-investors-301703337.html?enowpopup&enowparentmodules=opsconsole-csm,usage-tracking-csm%2Cdata-api-proxy-csm#financial-modal) to Core's shareholders and lenders presenting a $72 million financing plan that it believes will keep the miner from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.**

If the deal is approved, the first $40 million would be funded **"immediately, with zero contingencies,"** while the remaining funds would be issued if Core agrees to suspend payments to equipment lenders until Bitcoin's price returns to $18,500 — a price the leading cryptocurrency has been below since Nov. 9.

According to B. Riley, the funding will provide Core with two years of operational cash, and their analyst estimates that the miner may generate yearly earnings of around $165 million at a Bitcoin price of $18,000, with an additional $20 million for every $1,000 price increase.

**Core was heavily struck by the larger market collapse and submitted a report on Oct. 26 citing a low BTC price, high electricity rates, and a refusal to repay a $2.1 million loan from bankrupt crypto lender Celsius as reasons why it would default on some of its commitments.**

On Nov. 22, the miner revealed in a quarterly report that its cash reserves could be drained by the end of 2022 and that it did not expect it would be able to borrow funds through financing or capital markets given current market circumstances.
