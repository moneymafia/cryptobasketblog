B. Riley, a financial services company, has made offer to miner Core Scientific received a $72 million loan to stay afloat and maintain value for Core Scientific shareholders.

In a [letter](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-issues-open-letter-to-core-scientific-investors-301703337.html?enowpopup&enowparentmodules=opsconsole-csm,usage-tracking-csm%2Cdata-api-proxy-csm#financial-modal) dated December 14 outlining the conditions of the financing deal, B. Riley, a major lender to Core Scientific with $42 million in loans still outstanding, stated that it is willing to finance the first $40 million "immediately, with zero contingencies."

**The financial platform said the remaining $32 million would be subject to the Bitcoin miner stopping all payments to lenders of equipment while the price of Bitcoin is below $18,500.**

Bitcoin's price recently exceeded $18,500 on November 9 before dropping more than 14% in a single day.

The situation Core Scientific is in was harshly described by B. Riley, who claimed the company had adopted *"an aggressive, ill-conceived plan  to continue to build up power facilities and grow miners while never selling Bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices."*

It stated that as a result of this strategy, Core Scientific was compelled to sell 9,618 BTC in April for a price of $362 million, resulting in a huge loss for the miner.

In a quarterly report submitted on November 22, Core Scientific acknowledged that business lacked the funds necessary to operate into 2023. Additionally, it stated that it was unsure of its capacity to raise money through stock markets or finance.

**The company cited the low price of Bitcoin, rising power prices, and Celsius's failure to return a $2.1 million loan as the causes of its financial difficulties in a filing on October 26.**

B. Riley reminded the miner of its duty to shareholders and was optimistic Core Scientific would accept the loan offer, noting:

*“In our view it would be a gross violation of the fiduciary duties owed by the Board and Management for those fiduciaries—who must put our interests ahead of their own—to authorize a Chapter 11 filing.”*
