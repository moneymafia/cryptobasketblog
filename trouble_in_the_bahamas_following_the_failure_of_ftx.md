Following the downfall of crypto exchange FTX, which was situated on the island of Bahamas, Bahamians are said to be still attempting to make sense of things while remaining positive about the future.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the implosion of FTX has shook the island republic, which has encouraged bitcoin entrepreneurs to feel at home with its "copacetic regulatory touch.

The Bahamas was already trying to find methods to strengthen its economy, which relies largely on tourism and offshore finance for the majority of its gross domestic product, after Hurricane Dorian in 2019. The Bahamas' prime minister, Philip Davis, and his government appeared to believe that cryptocurrency may play a significant part in the island's economic revival.

The community now believes that FTX's abrupt demise has left a path of jobless on the tiny 80-square-mile island. When operating at full capacity, FTX employed locals, reportedly spending more than "$100,000 per week on catering." as well as set up a private shuttle service to transfer personnel about the island FTX also hired a number of Bahamians for positions in logistics, event development, and regulatory compliance. 

With the collapse of FTX, many high-spending foreigners who worked for the company and once boosted the local economy have reportedly fled the island, leaving Bahamian security guards to now guard “nearly vacant buildings." In the aftermath of the fall of FTX, some crypto community members have said they feel no sympathy for the effects of the collapse on the tiny island country.

According to a statement from the Royal Bahamas Police Force sent to Reuters on Nov 13, an investigation into possible criminal misconduct over the insolvency of FTX is underway by financial investigators and Bahamian securities regulators.
