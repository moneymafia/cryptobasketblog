GK8, an institutional digital asset self-custody platform owned by Celsius Network has been awarded to Mike Novogratz-led investment firm Galaxy Digital Holdings subject to court clearances and other closing requirements.


The platform's almost 40-person team including cryptographers and blockchain engineers, as well as the GK8 team office in Tel Aviv will be acquired by Galaxy as part of the agreement according to a [blog post](https://www.gk8.io/pr-galaxy-to-acquire-leading-custody-platform-gk8/) from GK8 on December 2 and a [press statement](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/galaxy-to-acquire-leading-custody-platform-gk8-887819028.html) from Galaxy, assuming the acquisition goes through.

Self-custody platform GK8 provides custody, staking, DeFi, NFT support, tokenization, and trading for managing blockchain-based assets.

The platform's developers assert that it can execute safe blockchain transactions without a network connection, significantly lowering the danger of hacking.

GK8 was purchased by Celsius in 2021 for $115 million, despite Galaxy not publicly disclosing the price it proposed for the company.

The purchase, according to Galaxy's founder and CEO Mike Novogratz is *"a vital cornerstone in our endeavour to build a genuinely full-service financial platform for digital assets."*

He stated, **"Adding GK8 to our main offering at this pivotal moment for our industry also highlights our continuous willingness to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow Galaxy in a sustainable manner."**


It was stated that Galaxy plans to support GK8's continued activities while employing its technology to expand GalaxyOne, its trading platform.

Galaxy's new custodial business will be run by GK8 founders including CEO Lior Lamesh and CTO Shahar Shamai, who are anticipated to remain with the organisation.

With Galaxy's support, Lamesh stated, **"We intend to launch new and innovative solutions into the market that demonstrate a combination of Galaxy's best-in-class services and GK8's cryptography, security, and unrivalled R&D capabilities."**
Since seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 13, Celsius has been in the bankruptcy process, outlining intentions to sell some of its assets.

According to the court document, Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky said the business would sell Bitcoin (BTC) generated by its mining operation in order to assist pay back at least one of its debts and generate future revenue.

In a document submitted on September 15 to the Southern District of New York's US Bankruptcy Court, Celsius requested authorization to liquidate its stablecoin assets.

For abandoning its acquisition intentions, institutional cryptocurrency custodial service and wallet operator **BitGo recently named Galaxy Digital in a $100 million lawsuit**.

On August 15, 2022, Galaxy cancelled the May, 2021 agreement to purchase the company, claiming BitGo's claimed violation of contract for failing to submit audited financial statements by July 31, 2022.

Then, on September 13, BitGo announced that it was suing Galaxy for more than $100 million in damages, claiming that Galaxy had **"improperly repudiated"** and "intentionally breached" the terms of their acquisition agreement with BitGo.
