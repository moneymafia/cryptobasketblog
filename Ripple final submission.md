After a two-year fight, the most talked-about cryptocurrency litigation involving the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is nearing its conclusion.

On December 2, the SEC and Ripple filed redacted answers to each other's applications for summary judgement.

Ripple argued in its motion [document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u971g2swao63xzh/Ripple%20Redacted%20Reply%20to%20SEC%20Opposition%20to%20Ripple%27s%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf?dl=0) that the SEC failed to prove that its XRP offerings between 2013 and 2020 constituted an **"investment contract"** and thus a security under federal securities laws.

Ripple concluded the document by saying, **"the court should grant the Defendant's Motion and deny the SEC's Motion."**

On December 3, Ripple's general counsel [Stuart Alderoty](https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1599430979667472385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1599430979667472385%7Ctwgr%5Efd786bd0ca619a95b5e753c3bddebad3ecbdc953%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fripple-files-final-submission-against-sec-as-landmark-case-nears-end), tweeted that this was the company's **"last submission"** requesting the judge to **"grant"** judgement in its favour.

He added that Ripple is proud of the defence it has mounted **"on behalf of the entire crypto industry"**, noting that Ripple has **"always played it straight with the court"**, but subtly criticising the SEC by saying he **"can't say the same for our adversary."** Ripple has been accused of engaging in illegal activities related to cryptocurrency.


Alderoty continued to criticise the SEC in a subsequent tweet on December 5, referring to it as a **"bouncing regulator"** and cited two statements that he said contradicted one another.

When the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that **the company had raised $1.3 billion by selling its native cryptocurrency XRP as unregistered securities**, the legal conflict between the two parties got underway.

James Filan, a former federal prosecutor, stated there are only three points left to be resolved in the SEC vs. Ripple case in a previous tweet from November 30.

The **"expert reports"**, the Hinman records and other information that the SEC and Ripple relied on in their motions are all covered by the summary judgement motions, expert challenges, and sealing disputes.

The William Hinman documents make reference to his June 2018 address at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit, in which he claimed that Ether (ETH) was not a security.
