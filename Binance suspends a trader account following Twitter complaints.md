Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, terminated a trader account on December 9 after a user complained about the firm's response to alleged funds theft. Binance CEO Changpeng **"CZ"** Zhao stated that the company does not wish to serve **"unreasonable"** customers.


On December 8, a Twitter user named CoinMamba began protesting about the lost funds, saying that a leaked API key linked to crypto trading business 3Commas was used **"to execute trades on low cap currencies to drive up the price to make profit."**

In a series of tweets, the trader argues that Binance was unable to offer him with adequate support:

Binance CEO also tweeted on December 9 to clear the air:

[![Tweet 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119027252/206891571-ceeb7782-e45f-4dcb-bd21-dc81be11cf21.jpg)](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1601193403257344000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1601193403257344000%7Ctwgr%5E78310b3e3bf593531c9349d6f55387668b26143b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbinance-suspends-trader-s-account-after-complaints-on-twitter)

As the customer complained repeatedly on the social networking site, CZ acknowledged in a subsequent tweet that it was thinking of putting the customer's account "in off boarding (withdrawal only) status," adding that **"we don't want to service those who are difficult."** The tweet was later [removed](https://twitter.com/coinmamba/status/1601268054314602496), but a screenshot of it is still there in the discussion. After that, the user had three days to withdraw money before their account was cancelled.

The user tweets claim that 3Commas rejected any attempt to abuse its protocols or databases and that as a result, it is not liable for the stolen API credentials. According to the information available at the time, neither encryption techniques nor the account security databases of 3Commas have been breached, according to 3Commas support.

The [CEO of Binance acknowledged](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1591974155783909377) on November 13 that at least three individuals saw unforeseen account activity after providing their API Key with the third-party services Skyrex and 3Commas. After that, he advised users to destroy associated API keys.

Coinmamba asserts to have been a customer of Binance for more than five years, and he continues to have open futures holdings there.
