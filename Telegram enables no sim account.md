Telegram, a messaging service has released a new update that allows users to register accounts using blockchain-based anonymous numbers rather than cell phone numbers.


Telegram now hides individuals's private phone numbers from non-added users, but users will soon be able to hide numbers from everyone which would likely gratify consumers who appreciate privacy-focused services.

For cryptocurrency fans, the chat platform has become a popular app. The change is part of a 9.2 update [released](https://telegram.org/blog/ultimate-privacy-topics-2-0) on December 6, which also allows users to set durations on messages in new chats to remove them automatically.

Users will need to purchase **"blockchain-powered anonymous numbers"** through Fragment, a decentralised auction site launched by Telegram creator Pavel Durov in order to use the function.

Fragment sells solely Telegram-compatible user names and anonymous numbers. Purchases on the platform are made using Telegram's linked cryptocurrency, **The Open Network (TON).**

However, Fragment does not provide its services to citizens in the United States.

People who purchase a number can then use these private numbers to receive verification code SMS after signing into Telegram.

**People can buy a random number on Fragment for 9 TON ($16) or buy and sell them in an auction.** It appears that some digits are in high demand, since *"+888 8 888"* now has the highest [offer](https://fragment.com/number/8888888) of 33,075 TON ($60,527) at the time of writing.

Following the FTX fiasco last month, Durov said on Nov. 30 via his Telegram channel that the business is developing a suite of decentralised tools in reaction to yet another instance of misconduct by a centralised crypto entity.

According to Durov, Telegram is planning to launch noncustodial wallets and decentralised exchanges, among other products.


*“The solution is clear: blockchain-based projects should go back to their roots – decentralization. Cryptocurrency users should switch to trustless transactions and self-hosted wallets that don't rely on any single third party,"* he wrote.
