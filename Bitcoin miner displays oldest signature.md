Online forums are important to the Bitcoin origin story, as Satoshi Nakamoto and early contributors discussed and built a revolutionary financial system from the ground up. [Bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/) one of the oldest Bitcoin forums, still keeps historical conversations about the creation of the logo and payment mechanism.

A interested user of the [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/) forum recently attempted to identify early Bitcoin miners. To their surprise **an anonymous person shared a signature from January 2009**, just a week after Bitcoin was created.

**"Perhaps the OP is inviting Satoshi?"** speculated another user after establishing the authenticity of **"the oldest signature"** discovered to far. To add to the intrigue the signature was posted on Nov. 26 2022, by a freshly created account using the alias OneSignature.

The address used by the unknown poster has no balance. The disclosure of the signature dating back to the Bitcoin genesis period demonstrates that those involved in developing Bitcoin's legacy keep a close eye on the ecosystem while occasionally feeding the general public's interest.

Despite decade-long regulatory challenges and extended bear markets, Bitcoin has always come out on top. However, declining Bitcoin prices have put additional strain on the mining environment.

Bitcoin mining revenue in US dollars is currently at two-year lows, down to $11.67 million, a figure last seen on November 2, 2020.
