Minnesota Senator Tom Emmer has chastised US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler for his failed **"crypto information-gathering operations,"** and has demanded that Gensler testify before Congress to explain the consequences of his **"regulatory failings."**


Emmer's comments came in a Dec. 10 [tweet](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1601334545705750532?s=20&t=_gaQq6jWiS_oaS4-RFkY1Q) to his 67,500 Twitter followers, in which he mentioned a bipartisan Blockchain Caucus letter he co-authored to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on March 16.

**"[Gensler](https://cryptobasket.org/posts/investigation-of-gensler-and-the-sec-role-in-the-ftx-collapse-is-demanded-by-a-congressman/) must appear before Congress and answer questions about the cost of his regulatory failings,"** the Senator continued.

According to Emmer, Gensler has not been before the House Committee on Financial Services since October 5 2021, leaving crypto media to fill the hole for the SEC's investigative failures.

The March Blockchain Caucus letter noted that the SEC's efforts to obtain information from crypto businesses were **"haphazard and unfocused,"** rather than **"targeted, purposeful, or clear."**

Emmer contended that Gensler's response, which came two months later, avoided several questions about the SEC's methodologies and processes for overseeing the digital asset business.

*“Instead, Gensler decided to explain to Congress the roles of the SEC’s Enforcement and Examination Divisions,”* Emmer wrote.

Emmer has previously criticised the financial watchdog's cryptocurrency oversight tactics.
*“Instead, Gensler decided to explain to Congress the roles of the SEC’s Enforcement and Examination Divisions,”*  he said on November 26.

Emmer had tweeted a few days earlier, on Nov. 23, that Gary Gensler's lack of leadership had contributed to FTX's tragic collapse, which occurred in early November.

Much of Gensler and the SEC's efforts in recent years have been focused on assessing whether cryptocurrencies meet the Howey test and hence are subject to US securities laws, most notably the ongoing Ripple lawsuit with its XRP (XRP) token.
