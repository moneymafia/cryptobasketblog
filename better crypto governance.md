Sasha Ivanov, the inventor of the Waves blockchain, claims to have a solution to some of the governance flaws seen in administering decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), such as the possibility of manipulation and voter apathy.

Existing DAOs based on basic token governance models and weighted voting methods provide holders voting power according to the number of governance tokens they own. This exposes them to manipulation by well-capitalized manipulators who may also prey on unaccountable and indifferent voters. DAO is the foundation of many decentralized applications such as compound and aave, and token holders have the ability to vote on modifications or updates that affect the project.


Simple token governance is appealing on paper but has proven ineffective in practice. Without enough accountability integrated into governance models, bad actors and those seeking to disrupt decision-making have no disincentive and will continue to gamify the system.

As a solution, Ivanov, the inventor of Wave Blockchain, created the Power Protocol, a set of rules and incentives to promote community engagement. The protocol is intended to establish and then monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), as well as to provide financial incentives and punishments to encourage responsible, transparent, and efficient community participation. 


If these KPIs are met, participating communities will be rewarded. If they are not satisfied, a community may be fined by having a percentage of its staked governance tokens destroyed.

Third-party DAOs may implement the Power Protocol. The concept may successfully reduce the danger of possible harm from unscrupulous actors and boost the effectiveness of any DAO, t does this by restricting the overall voting power of individual users.
