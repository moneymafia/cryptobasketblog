Pavel Durov, Telegram's creator and CEO, stated on November 30 that the company will develop a collection of decentralized tools, including non-custodial wallets and a decentralized crypto exchange. He stated that the wallet owner would keep its private keys, allowing them complete control over their crypto asset.


He stated in the tweet __"Telegram's next step is to build a set of decentralized tools, including non-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges for millions of people to trade and store cryptocurrencies securely. This way we can fix the wrongs caused by the current excessive centralization"__

He also said that Cryptocurrency users should switch to trustless transactions and self-hosted wallets that don't rely on any single third party,"


The blockchain industry was founded on the promise of decentralization, but it has become concentrated in the hands of a few who have begun to misuse their authority. Creating a set of decentralized tools for safely trading cryptocurrencies, such as non-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges, would assist to right the wrongs caused by excessive centralization, which has disappointed hundreds of thousands of bitcoin users.

Telegram is currently the most popular social media appÂ among cryptocurrency traders, and integrating a non-custodial wallet will only increase the platform's popularity.
