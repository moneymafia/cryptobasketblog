Just two days before the cryptocurrency exchange was forced to close, a high-ranking executive at FTX's Bahamian firm alerted local regulators to probable fraud at the exchange.


**Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets (FDM), alerted the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) on Nov. 9 that FTX was moving customer funds to its sister trading firm Alameda Research, according to Bahamian court filings filed on Dec. 14.**

Salame stated that the payments were intended to **"offset Alameda's financial losses,"** and that the transfer was **"not permitted or consented to by their clients."**

He also told the SCB that only three people had access to the client assets that needed to be transferred to Alameda: former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX co-founder Zixiao **"Gary"** Wang, and FTX engineer Nishad Singh.

Because the information **"may constitute misappropriation, theft, fraud, or some other crime,"** SCB executive director Christina Rolle contacted the commissioner of the Royal Bahamas Police Force to request an investigation.

The following day, on November 10, the SCB froze FDM's assets and stopped its registration in the country, and the Bahamian Supreme Court appointed a provisional liquidator to try to save the company's assets.

The records show the first recorded instance of an FTX or Alameda executive assisting authorities.

According to the documents Salame is believed to be in Washington, D.C. and has not spoken publicly since the exchange's demise.

His most recent public [tweet](https://twitter.com/rsalame7926/status/1589617343222939648) was on Nov. 7, when he replied **"lol [sic]"** to Binance co-founder Yi He, who explained why the exchange sold its FTX Token holdings.

In recent weeks, another former executive from FTX's connected companies is said to have been assisting authorities.

On December 4, speculation arose following photos purportedly showing Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison in a New York coffee shop a short walk away from the US Attorney's Office, prompting some to suspect she was cutting a deal with authorities in the aftermath of the FTX collapse.

Bankman-Fried is the only person charged from FTX and Alameda thus far, lending validity to the allegation that executives from both companies are cooperating authorities.

He is accused of money laundering, political campaign finance breaches, as well as wire and securities fraud.

Bankman-Fried, Wang, Singh, and Ellison are said to have run a **"Wirefraud"** group conversation using the encrypted messaging software Signal to share sensitive information about FTX and Alameda's operations. Bankman-Fried denied any knowledge of or participation in the group.
