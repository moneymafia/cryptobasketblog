Aave Companies, a software development company, today announced the acquisition of Sonar, a developer of the San Francisco-based metaverse in which users may construct worlds and interact with their creations using non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Aave Companies is the parent company of several cryptocurrency initiatives, including the stablecoin GHO, the emerging social network Lens Protocol, and the lending and borrowing protocol Aave.


**Ben South Lee and Randolph Lee, two of Sonar's co-founders, along with other team members will join Aave Companies as a result of the acquisition**. They will work on developing social-mobile applications that are powered by the Lens Protocol, a decentralised social media protocol built on Polygon that enables users to store their content as NFTs.

Sonar is an iOS gaming app that was released as a Y-Combinator offering in the summer of 2020. It enables users to create and discover digital spaces and participate in activities like listening to music, playing games, and interacting with other users via personalised "moji" [NFTs that are sold on the Opensea marketplace](https://opensea.io/collection/sonar-moji).

The [website for Sonar](https://moji.sonar.app/) describes emojis as *“mojis are sometimes cute, sometimes weird, but always entertaining collection of playable 3D avatars”*  that can communicate with others via voice and text, emote, and build emoji-based environments.

**Mojis have a body, a mouth, eyes, and other features. They also have a gem—a diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald, amethyst, or quartz—that symbolises the uniqueness of its individual components.**


Ben South Lee stated that incorporating the Lens Protocol into Sonar will assist the team in  **“figure out the right combinations that are approachable and familiar to anyone”.**

Ben Randolph and the Sonar team bring exceptional creativity and decades of valuable mobile, engineering, product design and market growth experience in social as well as their innovative product,  they say  Aave Companies CEO Stani Kulechov made a statement *"We are thrilled the Sonar team is joining our Lens team to accelerate our social media and mobile app strategy.”.*

Other Web3 consumer applications might be released as early as next year, according to the Sonar team, which also has plans to develop them.
