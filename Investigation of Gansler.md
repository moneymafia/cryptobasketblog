An independent probe into the Security and Exchange Commission's inability to stop the historic collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX is being demanded by a Democratic lawmaker.

Representative Ritchie Torres (D-NY) urged the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to launch an impartial investigation of the SEC's actions—or lack thereof—in the months preceding FTX's collapse last month in a letter that was sent on Tuesday.

An unusual move in the generally dry world of securities regulation, **the SEC released a colourful video starring Gensler the day before the charge to raise notice of the action.**

*“To what extent has Mr. Gensler’s demoralization of his own workforce crippled the Commission in the performance of its duty to protect investors?” Torres stated. “The public deserves an answer.”*

The letter also hinted to strife inside the SEC's own ranks, charging Gensler's actions with inciting mutiny among his employees.

*“Mr. Gensler’s leadership has left the career staff at the SEC fundamentally demoralized to an extent rarely seen, with the SEC Inspector General reporting the highest attrition rate in a decade,”* Torres wrote.   

Although the SEC has been looking into the cryptocurrency exchange for some time, no penalties or charges have been brought against FTX. But following FTX's collapse, the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have both opened inquiries into the **defunct $32 billion behemoth.**

**The SEC could have also lost control of overall crypto regulation. The majority of regulatory control over crypto would be given to the CFTC under a bipartisan Senate plan that has not yet been put to a vote.**

Representative Torres presented two proposals to the House on Monday that would immediately implement restrictions for cryptocurrency exchanges.
