Since Sam Bankman-FTX Fried's exchange abruptly went down a couple of weeks ago in a drama-filled flash, self-custody of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency assets is receiving a lot more attention.


The former third-largest exchange's users are unsure of when they will receive their money back. With this in mind, a growing number of consumers are opting to stop entrusting their money to centralised exchanges like FTX or Coinbase.

**"Private keys and automobile keys have some similarities. You risk letting someone else drive off with your automobile if you give them the sole key. You can do whatever you want if you maintain your key "** explained Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger.

Follow these instructions to transfer your money from an exchange to a wallet that you own if having complete control over your cryptocurrency appeals to you.

Before we continue, it is important to note that although self-custody helps users defend themselves against outsiders taking their money, it also necessitates far stricter personal accountability.

Users are required to write down a seed phrase, which functions as a password-like backup for all the addresses linked to the wallet. The associated Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is permanently lost if the seed phrase is lost.

There are several wallets you may use to hold your money if you're ready to accept the responsibility.

We will examine the well-known desktop wallet [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home).

After some basic setup, you'll be requested to create a new **"seed phrase"** once you've downloaded the Electrum wallet programme. The crucial **"password"** that we mentioned is this. Note the 12 words down. The most crucial step is this one because if you forget these words, there will be no support desk where you can go to get your money back. These words should be kept private and offline. Don't save these words to a file on your phone or computer, in other words.

There are many alternative wallets to select from, however they all generally operate in a similar way: *Write down the crucial phrases that must never be forgotten or disclosed, then download the wallet (on a desktop or mobile device)*.

Various wallets are needed for different cryptocurrencies. For example, MetaMask is a well-known mobile and web wallet that is used for self-custody of Ethereum and other compatible currencies. The most popular wallet for Solana and assets based on Solana is Phantom. There are also a tonne of more instances.

Using a hardware wallet, such as **Ledger or ColdCard**, which stores the keys in an offline environment and protects it from potential hacks, is another option with increased security.
It's time to transfer your money from the exchange into your new wallet—one that you (and you alone) control—after deciding on your wallet provider.

To begin, create a new address in your wallet to which you will send your Bitcoin (or other crypto). **In Electrum, you use the "receive" button to generate a Bitcoin "address," which is a jumbled string of numbers and letters similar to an email address. The address has already been created in MetaMask, Phantom, and other similar browser-based wallets, and you'll need to click on "Account" or "Deposit" or a similar button to copy that address to your computer's clipboard**.

On your account page at your chosen exchange, say Coinbase, there will be a "Withdraw" button for each of your assets. To send funds to your wallet, click the **"Withdraw"** button for the corresponding asset ("Bitcoin" for a Bitcoin wallet, "Ethereum" for an Ethereum wallet, and so on), paste in the address from your self-custody wallet, and click "Send."

The exchange will frequently prompt you to ensure that you're copying the correct wallet address or to confirm that you truly want to withdraw your funds, but the mechanics will vary depending on the exchange.

What happens now that you've transferred your cryptocurrency from an exchange to your own self-custody wallet? *"Do your own research" (DYOR)* is a popular phrase in the Bitcoin community because there is so much information to learn about cryptocurrency. Self-custody could be considered a [rabbit hole](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html) worth delving into.

Beyond the options described above, there are more complex options for self-custody.

For example, *"multi-sig"* wallet options, such as Casa, provide greater flexibility. Instead of just one private key, the wallet is protected by several. As a result, even if the user loses one key, his or her funds are still secure. (However, if two keys go missing, you're out of luck.)

For added peace of mind, some users carve their seed phrase into metal plates. If, for example, the location where their seed phrase is stored burns down, the seed phrase should still be readable.

And, as Neuman points out, the user experience of self-custody is constantly improving. Casa, for example, does not necessitate writing down or remembering the seed phrase. *"It's something that anyone can do. We believe we can continue to improve it in such a way that anyone in the world can safely hold their own keys "* Neuman stated.
