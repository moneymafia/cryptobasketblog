1inch Network, a leading decentralised finance (DeFi) aggregator, released __Fusion__, a substantial update centred on its 1inch Swap Engine. The Fusion update intends to provide crypto investors with cost-effective, safe, and lucrative swaps.

DeFi investors can use the Fusion mode in 1inch Swap Engine to make orders with a predetermined price and time range without incurring network costs. The patch also provides network enhancements like as improved staking contracts and tokenomics.

The 1inch Swap Engine links DeFi users and offers liquidity for crypto transactions through professional market makers as a decentralised trading and matching mechanism. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch Network, explained the motivation for the Fusion upgrade:

__"Fusion significantly reduces the cost of 1inch swaps by eliminating network expenses; also, an extra layer of protection is introduced, protecting customers against sandwich attacks."__

In contrast to the previous centralised method, 1inch's recent improvement enables investors to make safe non-custodial swaps in a completely permissionless and trustless manner.

According to the release, 1inch provides infinite liquidity and employs a novel decentralised order-matching strategy based on the Dutch auction paradigm, as seen below.

The Fusion option enables users to swap tokens across several DEXs without incurring network costs. The update also allows users to customise the order execution time to meet their own needs.

Furthermore, the Fusion mode protects against the maximum extractable value (MEV), which is the maximum value that may be harvested from block production over and above the usual block reward and gas fees.
