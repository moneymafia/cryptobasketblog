The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit on Thursday to prevent Microsoft from acquiring Activision Blizzard, the creators of the Call of Duty and Overwatch franchises. According to the FTC, the agreement would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over its competitors in the gaming business, thus creating a monopoly.


**Microsoft revealed the potential [acquisition](https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/) in January, reportedly worth $68.7 billion**. The FTC described it as the largest transaction in the video gaming industry's history.

If successful, the lawsuit would stymie Microsoft's foray into the still-nascent metaverse. The corporation has made various measures in that regard, including forming a **"Open Metaverse"** with Meta, Sony, and others.


According to the Metaverse Standards Forum, its goal is to increase coordination and cooperation among companies working to construct the next generation of the internet.

The FTC noted Microsoft's purchase of Bethesda Titles Studios, developers of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises, as well as the exclusivity of its Starfield and Redfall games to its flagship Xbox console.

The agency's complaint also mentions **Microsoft's track record of acquiring and leveraging valuable gaming material to stifle competition from competing consoles, such as its acquisition of ZeniMax, parent company of Bethesda Softworks** (a well-known game developer)

Blockchain developers have expressed concerns about Microsoft and Meta dominating the next internet and creating closed ecosystems and walled gardens, which Meta has refuted. Other worries revolve around the lack of ownership possibilities for players in a metaverse built by significant Web2 firms.

While Microsoft is entering the metaverse, it appears that the company has no plans to integrate **"Web3"** products, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), into its existing virtual worlds. NFTs were banned on the company's game servers in July, including the global phenomenon Minecraft.

*"To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications,"* the company stated in a news post. *"Nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilized by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset."*

According to the FTC, if the Activision Blizzard merger is approved, Microsoft will have the means and motivation to harm competition by manipulating pricing, game quality, and player experience on Activision games on competing platforms and game services.

Activision CEO Bobby Kotick responded to the FTC lawsuit by writing, *“The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn’t align with the facts, and we believe we’ll win this challenge.”*


Activision Blizzard's Senior Vice President of Litigation, Regulatory, and Public Policy Law, Jeb Boatman, wrote an open letter to employees saying it's extremely unlikely that Microsoft would make its **"Call of Duty"** games exclusive to the Xbox.

*"Microsoft has spent the last year promising global regulators, tens of millions of players, and competing consoles and platforms that they won’t do that,"* Boatman wrote. *"Do people really think that Microsoft—one of the world’s most respected companies—would risk its reputation and relationships to go back on that promise?"*

*“The player backlash would be disastrous,"* he also stated. *"It would destroy Microsoft’s trust with players and its brand, something Microsoft has spent decades building and protecting."*
