Approximately 22 months after the global exchange released the option for its users outside of the U.S. in 2021, the United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance US has finally brought out its Binance Pay service.


The service, which first launched in beta in February 2021 for peer-to-peer payments before being made available to merchants on March 12 for fee-free transactions, enables mobile users of the Binance app to instantaneously transact with almost 150 supported cryptocurrencies.

Binance US clients are now able to use mobile payments.

The **"Pay"** function, which its global parent company released for users outside the US in 2021, has now been made available to US users by Binance's US division.

Approximately 22 months after the global exchange released the option for its users outside of the U.S. in 2021, the United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance US has finally brought out its Binance Pay service.


The service, which first launched in beta in February 2021 for peer-to-peer payments before being made available to merchants on March 12 for fee-free transactions, enables mobile users of the Binance app to instantaneously transact with almost 150 supported cryptocurrencies.

In a blog post published on December 13 by Binance US, the company confirms that Pay transactions will have [no transaction or gas costs](https://blog.binance.us/binance-us-introduces-pay/) and mentions that the app is now only accessible on mobile devices while getting ready to launch a web version **"which will appear in the near future."**

While everything was going on, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) praised the Binance American branch and urged it to **"Keep developing"** in the face of recent FUD against Binance worldwide.

Users of [Binance.US](https://binance.us/) must update to the newest version of the app, go through identification verification, and fill their Pay wallet in order to utilise the new services.


However, the service is limited to facilitating user-to-user transactions on the Binance US mobile app. Every 24 hours, users can get up to $1 million in cryptocurrency.

The most recent news was made when the international crypto exchange was experiencing turbulence.

According to [on-chain monitoring tool Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/Balance), **Binance still maintains a Bitcoin balance in excess of 527,304 BTC despite the withdrawals. As of the time of writing, Binance's Bitcoin balance has decreased by over 42,000 in the previous 24 hours, or over $754 million.**

The withdrawals are thought to have been in response to a Dec. 13 Reuters [report](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/) that suggested the U.S. Department of Justice was wrapping up an investigation into Binance that had started in 2018. According to the report, US prosecutors are divided over whether there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against the exchange and its executives.

Additionally, there have been recent worries about Binance's finances in the crypto community. According to accounting and financial experts consulted by the Wall Street Journal in a report published on December 10, the company's proof of reserves raise a number of concerns, and the community is fearful of the worst.
