Italy plans to impose a 26% tax on digital asset gains exceeding 2,000 euros. The Italian tax authorities presently recognize digital currencies and tokens as foreign currency and levy a tax on them at a rate lower than the proposed 26%.

The new plan is part of Italy's projected budget for 2023 .  To encourage Italians to register their holdings of digital assets in their tax returns, Prime Minister "Giorgia Meloni's" administration has proposed a measure that allows taxpayers the option of declaring the value of assets as of January 1, 2023 and paying a 14% tax.
