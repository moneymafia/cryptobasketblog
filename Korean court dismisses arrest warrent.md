According to reports, a Seoul Southern District Court judge has issued arrest warrants for Terra co-founder Shin Hyun-seong, three Terra investors, and four Terra developers.

According to a Dec. 3 Yonhap News Agency [report](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20221203000700004), **Judge Hong Jin-Pyo stated that there was little risk of Shin or Terra associates deleting evidence linked to the crypto firm's case**, and quashed warrants issued by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office on Nov. 29. According to the source, Terra co-founder Do Kwon, who is also facing legal action in South Korea for his part in the firm's demise, is unlikely to return to the nation.

**"The Seoul Southern District Court's decision on December 3rd to reject South Korean prosecutors' detention warrant petitions for former Terraform Labs employees demonstrates the spurious nature of the prosecutors' charges once again"** a Terra representative said that.

Yoo Mo, the head of business at Terraform Labs, was detained by South Korean authorities in October, but Judge Hong quickly overturned the warrant, stating that it was difficult to understand the **"necessity and significance"** of the detention. Kwon, on the other hand, continued to be a target of lawmakers and authorities due to the addition of his name to Interpol's Red Notice list and the fact that he no longer had a valid South Korean passport for international travel.

Despite many cryptocurrency users directly blaming him for their losses of assets and the circumstances leading up to the current bear market, Kwon has continued to be active on social media in the wake of Terra's collapse. The co-founder of Terra declared in September that he was "making zero attempt to hide" from law enforcement.
