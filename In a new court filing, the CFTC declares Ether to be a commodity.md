In a Dec. 13 court filing, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) designated Ether as a commodity, contradicting assertions made by head **Rostin Behnam on Nov. 30 that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that should be treated as a commodity.**

The regulator [refers](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631227/1/commodity-futures-trading-commission-v-bankman-fried/) to Ether, Bitcoin, and Tether (USDT) as **"commodities"** under US law on many occasions in its case against Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and sister business Alameda Research

However, at least in recent weeks, there appears to be significant disagreement inside the CFTC itself about whether Ether should be considered a commodity or not.

During a crypto symposium at Princeton University on Nov. 30, CFTC chairman Rostin Benham reportedly suggested that Bitcoin is the only crypto asset that should be viewed as a commodity â€“ taking back prior comments which asserted that Ether may also be a commodity.

Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has similarly taken an uncertain stance on Ether in recent months.

On June 27, during the hosts' Mad Money show, [Gensler confirmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTa_3W8rMno) that Bitcoin was a commodity, adding, *"That's the only one I'm going to say."*

Gensler previously stated that Ether was a security during its initial coin offering but had since decentralised and become a commodity.

**After Ether's switch to [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://cryptobasket.org/posts/the-blockchain-will-be-affected-by-several-effects-of-ethereum-s-merger/)**, his attitude appeared to flip again in September, when he stated that staked tokens may qualify as securities under the Howey test.

The classification of crypto assets is especially relevant in the United States, because the CFTC oversees commodities futures, and the Securities and Exchange Commission regulates securities such as bonds and stocks (SEC).

Skeptic of cryptocurrency Senator Elizabeth Warren is reportedly working on legislation that would give the SEC most of the regulatory authority over the crypto industry, and **Intercontinental Exchange Inc CEO Jeffrey Sprecher is also confident that crypto assets will be treated as securities, implying that this would result in greater consumer protections at a financial services conference on December 6.**

Belgium, on the other hand, has taken a different stand on the categorization, claiming in a Nov. 22 report that Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto assets produced exclusively by computer code do not constitute securities.
