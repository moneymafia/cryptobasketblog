El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has decided to __instal more than 200 bitcoin ATMs around the country__ as part of his efforts to make Bitcoin legal tender. El Salvador was the third-largest hub for bitcoin ATMs in September 2021, behind the United States and Canada, but in 2022, Spain and Australia surpassed El Salvador in terms of ATM density.

El Salvador, __the first country to legalise Bitcoin__, has fallen another spot in terms of total crypto ATM installations, with Australia reporting 216 ATMs as we near 2023.

Spain deployed 215 crypto ATMs, making it __the third-largest crypto ATM hub in the world__. However, Spain maintained its installation campaign and has 226 crypto ATMs as of this writing. El Salvadorâ€™s reign as the fourth-largest hub for crypto ATMs was brief because Australia improved over the ensuing months.
