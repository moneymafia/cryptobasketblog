Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and the crypto fintech Moonpay, are [facing a class-action lawsuit](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CELEBS-NFT-SUIT.pdf) for allegedly leveraging celebrities to advertise and sell nonfungible tokens in a misleading manner (NFTs).


**The complaint names over 40 defendants, including Paris Hilton, Snoop Dogg, Jimmy Fallon, Justin Bieber, Madonna, Serena Williams, Post Malone, and Diplo**. The class action, filed on December 8 in the Central District of California by John T. Jasnoch of Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP, says the crypto corporations leveraged their Hollywood network to promote the digital assets without complying with disclosure laws. According to the document:

*"This case epitomizes these concerns as it involves a vast scheme between a blockchain start-up company, Yuga Labs, Inc. (“Yuga”), a highly connected Hollywood talent agent (Defendant Guy Oseary), and a front operation (MoonPay), who all united for the purpose of promoting and selling a suite of digital assets."*

According to the lawsuit, Yuga Labs and Oseary executives devised a strategy to use a wide network of A-list singers, athletes, and celebrity customers in order to give investors the impression of **"joining the club"** through Yuga's flagship NFT line.

*"The exclusiveness of BAYC membership was entirely based on the inclusion and endorsements of highly influential celebrities. But this purported interest in, and endorsement of, the BAYC NFTs by high-profile taste makers was entirely manufactured by Oseary at the behest of the Executive Defendants."*, alleges the suit.

Adonis Real and Adam Titcher, the two plaintiffs in the case, purchased Yuga Labs NFTs collections between April 2021 and the present. The class action also makes reference to a previous Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statement about celebrity endorsements, claiming that **"these endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement."**

Yuga Labs is also being investigated by US officials as part of a larger probe into the NFT business. According to reports, the SEC is looking into Yuga Labs to see if certain NFTs are **"more analogous to stocks"** and whether their sale violates federal laws.
