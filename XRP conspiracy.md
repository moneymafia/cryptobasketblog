The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is allegedly being surreptitiously controlled by Ripple, according to a conspiracy theory created by ChatGPT, an AI tool. This claim has been refuted by Ripple's chief technical officer.


In response to inquiries about the decentralisation of Ripple's XRP Ledger, the ChatGPT bot reportedly said that while anyone might participate in the governance of the blockchain, Ripple had **"ultimate authority"** over XRPL, according to a Dec. 3 Twitter [thread by user Stefan Huber](https://twitter.com/Leerzeit/status/1599063819661111296).

The AI said that Ripple may have **"abilities that are not fully disclosed in the public source code"** when asked how this is feasible without the consensus of participants and its publicly-available code.

XRPL's **"ultimate decision-making power"** reportedly **"still remains with Ripple Labs"** at one time, and the business might make adjustments  *“even if those changes do not have the support of the supermajority of the participants in the network.”*

It also stated that Bitcoin was **"really decentralised"** in comparison to the XRPL.

The bot's reasoning, according to Ripple CTO David Schwartz, should be questioned because, he claims, Ripple may use it to covertly manage the Bitcoin network since it is impossible to tell from the code.

In the course of the interaction, the bot was also shown to contradict itself, claiming that the main benefit of using  “a distributed ledger like the XRPL is to enable secure and efficient transactions without the need for a central authority,” despite having previously claimed that the XRPL is centralised in management.


The OpenAI-developed chatbot ChatGPT is made to engage with users **"in a conversational style"** and respond to inquiries on virtually any topic. Even complex activities like developing and testing smart contracts are within its capabilities.

OpenAI warns that because the AI was trained on  *“vast amounts of data from the internet written by humans, including conversations”* according to OpenAI and warned because of this some of the bot's reponses can be **“inaccurate, untruthful, and otherwise misleading at times.”**


When it was released on Nov. 30, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it **"an early demo"** and a **"very much research release."** According to a [tweet](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-faq) from Altman on December 5th, the tool has already seen over one million users.

In a tweet on December 4, Ethereum founder [Vitalik Buterin also commented](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1599461801040936960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1599461801040936960%7Ctwgr%5Eabee0614a2ff1f743647197c73b4374ebb4086df%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fripple-cto-shuts-down-xrp-conspiracy-theory-from-chatgpt) on the AI chatbot, noting that it  **“will be free from human biases has probably died the hardest.”**
