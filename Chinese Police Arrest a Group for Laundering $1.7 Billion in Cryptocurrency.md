Chinese authorities operating out of the Mongolian city of Tonglio announced the arrest of 63 people involved in a massive **money laundering scheme involving the Tether stablecoin that netted $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency.**


According to the police [statement](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JO3lpwKXj66ef0wf9qo3vw), the investigation began when a large surge in deposits totaling more than ten million yuan hit a local bank, triggering the bank's anti-money laundering protocols. Chinese authorities confiscated a total of 130 million Chinese yuan (approximately $18.6 million) in subsequent raids.

According to Chinese police, the criminals formed the group on Telegram and recruited members to open cryptocurrency exchange accounts. Because of China's harsh cryptocurrency crackdown, these exchanges were most likely located outside of the country. The gang would pay members a commission based on how much money they could convert back into Chinese yuan.

**The gang began its illegal operation in May 2021, at the same time that the Chinese government imposed a broad ban on cryptocurrencies, including fines and potential jail terms for Chinese citizens found guilty of using cryptocurrency.**

Initially, the crackdown was intended to reduce carbon consumption. Since then, the Chinese government has begun to roll out its digital yuan currency.

Countries around the world, including Japan, Australia, China, and the United States, have begun to develop their own version of the digital dollar.

**In April 2021, the region of Inner Mongolia, where Tonglio is located shut down the Bitcoin mining farms that had been operating in the area due to its low energy costs. Following the crackdown, many Bitcoin miners relocated to Kazakhstan, while others moved to the United States.**

Even so, underground crypto operations in China continue to use proxy servers and virtual private networks (VPNs).

*"As the ban has taken effect and time has passed, it appears that underground miners have grown more confident and appear content with the protection offered by local proxy services,"* the Cambridge Digital Assets Programme reported in May 2022
