A US banking industry regulator warned banks of the **"emerging risks"** of cryptocurrencies, advising them to be **"cautious"** and seek permission in some cases when dealing with crypto or crypto firms.


The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) highlighted **"several key risks"** of crypto in its Semiannual Risk Perspective for Fall 2022 [report](https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/semiannual-risk-perspective/files/semiannual-risk-perspective-fall-2022.html) on December 8, citing "dislocations" in the crypto market over 2022.

Its three main concerns are that **"stablecoins may be unstable,"** the crypto industry lacks mature risk management practises, and there is a high risk of contagion due to the crypto industry's **"high degree of interconnectedness."**

The lack of **"consistent or comprehensive regulation"** in the space, as well as the volatility of crypto, as well as the increased number of firms offering **"bank-like products and services"** using crypto and tokenized assets, were also cited as concerns by the OCC, raising concerns about financial stability.


The depeg and collapse of the TerraClassicUSD (USTC) algorithmic stablecoin in May was cited as an example of stablecoin **"run risk,"** as were minor depeg events in asset-backed stablecoins.

It noted that stablecoin backings have **"incrementally evolved"** since then, but that most **"remain vulnerable to risk."**

Concerning risk management, the OCC stated that practises at crypto firms are maturing but **"not yet robust,"** with firms appearing **"unprepared for the stresses and surprises"** that have befallen millions of investors over the past year. Also stating *“Hacks and outages are frequent, and fraud and scams remain high throughout the industry. In some cases, ownership rights, custody arrangements, and financial representations have created a high degree of confusion.”*

According to the OCC, the crypto market over 2022 revealed the industry's **"interconnectedness through a variety of opaque lending and investing arrangements."**

It stated that cryptocurrency participants **"may be engaging in highly leveraged trading,"** resulting in the noted contagion risk.

The OCC advised banks to "take a careful and incremental approach" when dealing with cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency companies.

The OCC advised national banks to discuss crypto-related plans **"with their supervisory office"** before engaging in any activities, as some may require permission.

Following FTX's bankruptcy, crypto companies have moved to improve transparency, with many exchanges implementing proof-of-reserves so users can verify crypto backings and some conducting public third-party audits.
