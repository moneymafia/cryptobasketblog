The Schall Law Firm a shareholder rights litigation firm, has taken on the responsibility of looking into the investors' claims against FTX for breaking securities laws in order to aid the newly defrauded purchasers of FTX Tokens.

Over a million people are said to have lost their life savings as a result of the financial fraud carried out by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The law firm intends to look into whether FTX made false claims or omitted material facts in order to assist the investors in recovering losses through legal means.

**In a formal statement, Schall Law Firm emphasised how numerous media outlets exposed the operational flaws at FTX-Alameda, ultimately causing the collapse of FTX's internal FTT tokens.**

All FTT investors were urged by the legal firm to take part in the initiative by giving details about their purchases and sales of FTT tokens. Investors should be aware that they are not represented by counsel till the class is certified, at which point the court decides that a class action is the appropriate way to handle the numerous claims.

**Additionally, crypto entrepreneurs think that [SBF intentionally attempted to disrupt the cryptocurrency market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivals-worried-sam-bankman-fried-tried-to-destabilize-crypto-on-eve-of-ftx-collapse-11670597311) in order to salvage FTX, including Tether executives and Binance CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao.**

To recover the investors' lost funds, FTX has employed a group of financial forensic investigators. The company's main objective is to carry out "asset tracing" in order to locate and recover the missing digital assets.

According to James Bromley, a partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, on November 22 **"a large number of assets have either been taken or are missing"** from FTX. He is a counsel for FTX debtors. Additionally, he said that companies that specialise in blockchain analytics, such Chainalysis, had been hired to assist with the proceedings.
