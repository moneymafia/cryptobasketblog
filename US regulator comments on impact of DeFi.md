A financial regulator in the United States is seeking feedback from the banking industry on how decentralised finance (DeFi) may affect the bureau's efforts to combat financial crime.


The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stated that it is **"looking attentively"** at DeFi, while interim director Himamauli Das stated that the digital asset ecosystem and virtual currencies are a **"major focus area"** for the agency.

Das delivered prepared [remarks](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-acting-director-himamauli-das-during-abaaba-financial-crimes) at the American Bankers Association's Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference on December 6.

The interim director also stated that the agency is **"taking a close look"** at its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT) framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets to determine whether **“additional regulations or guidance are necessary.”**

*“We are engaging with relevant U.S. government stakeholders in this effort,”* said Das. *“We welcome engagement with industry — including the banking community — to better understand your assessment of the vulnerabilities and risks.”*

The regulator was particularly concerned about DeFi's **“potential to reduce or eliminate the role of financial intermediaries”** which is important to its AML and CFT activities.

The agency will need to reduce the  **“will continue to impact the financial services industry”** and the agency will need to mitigate the **“illicit finance and national security risks posed by the misuse of digital assets.”**

The Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets, signed by US President Joe Biden on March 9, calls on FinCEN to evaluate its AML and CFT standards.


The U.S. Treasury Department's  **“Action Plan to Address Illicit Financing Risks of Digital Assets.”**

The strategy called for more private sector participation, among other priorities, through *“the publication of official documents, discussions, and Treasury programs that enable public‐private and private‐private information sharing.”*
