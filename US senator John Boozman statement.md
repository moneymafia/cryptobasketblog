Boozman stated in his opening remarks at the hearing on Thursday titled **"Why Congress Needs to Act: Lessons Learned from the FTX Collapse"** that prosecutors view Bitcoin as a commodity. He continued by saying that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should oversee exchanges that permit BTC trading (CFTC).

**"Despite being a cryptocurrency, bitcoin is a commodity. Both the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the federal courts view it as a commodity. There is no debate over this "** He further stated:

*"If there are exchanges where commodities are traded—be it wheat, oil, or Bitcoin—then they must be regulated. It is that simple. The choice not to regulate leaves consumers at the mercy of those who would prey upon them."*

FTX, previously the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, collapsed, and the senator brought it up, claiming that while being a foreign firm, it caused losses for US clients.

He continued by saying that the CFTC is the appropriate regulatory body for digital commodities, such as Bitcoin and any cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates BTC trade. He asserted that the CFTC might assist in defending consumers by developing and putting into effect sensible regulatory frameworks that let markets to operate.

*"There is no better example of this than the CFTC’s regulation of the futures market, which has proven to be one of the more resilient markets, in large part because of the CFTC’s tried and trusted principles-based regulatory regime."*

The CFTC an independent US government body founded in 1974 oversees the derivatives markets, which include futures swaps and specific types of options. The CFTC's current chairman is Rostin Behnam.


Behnam claimed cryptocurrencies was **"possibly a danger to national security"** during the first congressional oversight session on Thursday after being questioned by senators about the absence of regulations in space.

Behnam added that controlling cryptocurrency would not be simple. According to him, cryptocurrencies would continue to exist even if the US government were to outright outlaw them. He claimed that 2% of FTX consumers were Americans despite geofencing laws and prohibitions.

He responded, **"That's not meant to happen. Even if it's illegal in the U.S., people will find a way to access offshore businesses and activities, therefore we need to take action"**.
