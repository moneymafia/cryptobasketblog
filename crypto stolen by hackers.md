A report claims that the BNB Chain weakness, which let hackers to steal $590 million from the network, was the greatest breach in October. The BNB Chain was quickly halted as the news surfaced, preventing the hacker from moving the majority of assets off-chain, therefore the attacker only made escape with about $100 million.


Nearly $2.98 billion in bitcoin losses have been caused by DeFi attacks this year, nearly twice as much as the $1.55 billion in losses in 2021.

A hacker established a sizable stake in MNGO-PERP and counter-traded themselves in the MNGO protocol breach, another DeFi attack that garnered media attention. All of the protocol's liquidity, or about $100 million worth of assets, was drained by the offender.


The assault on Ronin Bridge, which was responsible for $625 million of the $710 million that hackers took in March, was the most major exploit of the year. The Wormhole bridge exploit, which saw a hacker steal approximately $320 million in wrapped ETH via the Wormhole protocol, was the second-largest assault in terms of financial resources.


According to a report, DeFi protocols have been the target of the majority of the year's significant attacks, which worries crypto aficionados. Hackers targeted centralised exchanges for the most of 2019. However, during the previous 22 months, hackers used DeFi systems to steal around $6.7 billion.
