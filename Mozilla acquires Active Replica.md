Mozilla, best known for its online browser Firefox, has joined the rush of legacy internet platforms into the Web3 and metaverse development arena.

On November 30, the business [announced](https://hubs.mozilla.com/labs/welcome-active-replica/) its acquisition of Active Replica, an immersive experience developer, in a blog post.

Active Replica has joined Mozilla's Hubs maker platform to assist in the creation of virtual events. Earlier this year, the virtual experience creator collaborated with Mozilla during its multi-day arts and technology festival Mozfest.

According to Mozilla, **the acquisition will also help to expedite in-demand work, tailored subscription tiers, onboarding improvements, and the addition of new Hubs engines features**.

In an official statement, Active Replica stated that it will continue to engage with existing partners, but that the Mozilla acquisition will help it achieve its long-term ambitions saying:
*“Together, we see this as a key opportunity to bring even more innovation and creativity to Hubs than we could alone.”*

The next day, the business [announced](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/pulse-joins-the-mozilla-family/) the acquisition of Pulse, a machine learning developer, marking Mozilla's turn to focus on the future of the internet.

Mozilla's decision to expand its metaverse plans comes as the metaverse continues to garner interest both inside and outside of the Web3 area.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, claims it's **"powering through"** with metaverse plans despite significant financial and labour losses in its metaverse development division.

Meanwhile, as activity increases in digital reality, global leaders such as the World Economic Forum have begun to consider a worldwide metaverse strategy. There is currently no overarching policy that governs digital reality.

However, fresh data show that as activity grows, so do the **chances of exploitation, indicating the importance of legislation and ethical norms**.
