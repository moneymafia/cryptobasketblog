[Decentranland](https://decentraland.org/), a metaverse platform, has [announced](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/market/rentals/) a new platform feature that allows its users who own virtual LAND to essentially become landlords. Owners can now rent out their property to other platform users for predefined periods of time.


This enables users to generate passive income from their metaverse assets.

LAND owners are defined by Decentraland as accounts or wallet addresses that own the smart contract for LAND, whether it is **"a Parcel, an Estate, or both."**

**All LAND rentals are performed in Decentraland's native token, and are paid in full up front. The platform provided examples such as digital universities renting land to build campuses or DJs renting space for a club or party**.

Similarly to most rental contracts for physical properties, Decentraland landlords cannot sell the land or receive any purchasing bids until the rental contract period has expired.

Decentraland Twitter followers suggested that the same rental service be made available for wearables. The overall reaction of the community was positive.

This comes as the metaverse continues to evolve and gain traction both within and outside the Web3 industry.

The term **"metaverse"** was considered for the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year, but came in second place.

[**Mozilla recently acquired Active Replica**](https://cryptobasket.org/posts/mozilla-programmer-mozilla-goes-all-in-on-metaverse--acquiring-active-replica/) to boost its metaverse prowess and improve its users' digital experiences. While the metaverse and GameFi developer Animoca confirmed rumours of a billion dollar metaverse fund for developers looking to build out digital reality.

The metaverse, particularly mega-events like festivals and fashion week continues to serve as an entry point for new community members and developers into the larger world of Web3.
